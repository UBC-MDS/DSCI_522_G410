 This is Group 410's project for DSCI 522 (Data Science workflows); a course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

## Overview

For this project, we will be using the [Fifa 19 complete player dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19) [1] to answer the question: ***"What are the most important features in determining a football (soccer) player's salary?".***

Some sub-questions that we also plan to address include:
 - Are salaries correlated with ratings? If there is a strong correlation (which we would expect), we might be able to infer that the most important features for predicting salary might also be the best for predicting player quality/rating.
 - Who are the most overpaid and underpaid players in the world? Is there a trend by country/league/teams?
 - Are domestic players valued more highly than foreign players?
 - Which clubs have the best and worst economy in terms of a player potential to wage ratio?
 - Are different features more important for different positions?

 To answer our primary question we plan to fit a logistic regression model and compare the weights of key features.  Additional details can be found in our [project proposal](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_G410/blob/master/doc/proposal.md).
