## Introduction

Most soccer leagues (and in fact many sports other sports leagues around the world) have rules limiting the number of foreign players that any team can have on their squad. In England's Premier League, the [Homegrown Player Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homegrown_Player_Rule_(England)) requires that each team has a minimum of 8 'homegrown' (or 'domestic') players on their 25 man sqad.  I've often wondered if rules like this actually result in domestic players being overvalued. What else could explain Manchester United paying over 30 million pounds for an average player like Luke Shaw when he was just a teenager?!  

For this project, we will attempt to answer the inferential question: **Are domestic soccer players overpaid?** Or in a more statistical context, we will be *testing the hypothesis that the mean overpaid index is greater for domestic players than foreign players*.  

## Methodology

### Data Sources

For this project, we sourced player salaries and attributes from the [FIFA 19 complete player dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19) [@kaggle_fifa] from [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com). The dataset was downloaded and uploaded to one of our team member's public github repository (see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mglu123/live_dash_demo/master/data-2.csv)).

Unfortunately, the FIFA dataset does not include information on leagues and locations, so we needed another data source to be able to determine whether a player is a domestic or foreign player.  To be able to link clubs with a league location, we manually created a dictionary table of `Club`, `League`, and `Country` values sourced from the official [EA Games website](https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/news/fifa-19-leagues-and-teams) [@fifa] and uploaded it to another public github repo (located [here](https://github.com/hwilliams10/fifa_data/blob/master/clubs_and_leagues.csv)).

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Before starting our analysis, we did some exploration on the range of wages using the statistical package python [@python].  One thing we looked at is which features were most strongly correlated with wage. If every player were to receive fair compensation based on their value, we would expect wage to be most strongly associated with their overall FIFA ranking (which is how FIFA measures how valuable a player is).  

```{r}
# print top 10 features ignoring first three which are other types of wage
wage_df <- wage_corr_df %>% 
  rename("Feature" = X1, 
         "Correlation Coefficient" = "Wage") %>% 
  mutate(Feature = case_when(Feature == 'Wage' ~ "Weekly Wage ($1000's)",
                             Feature == 'Overall' ~ "Overall FIFA Ranking",
                             Feature == 'Special' ~ "Special Skills",
                             TRUE ~ Feature))
kable(wage_df[4:9,], caption = "**Table 1. Top 5 Features Correlated with Player Wage (Ignoring Wage/Salary Features)**")
```

From Table 1, we see that the overall FIFA ranking is reasonably correlated with a player's wage, but not as highly as one might expect. We also see that it is likely that the richest clubs also have the highest paid players which is intuitive.  

*Note: The EDA analysis is performed by the [`eda.py`](../src/eda.py) script in the [`src`](../src/) directory. Additional details on the EDA process and findings are presented in the [EDA Report](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_G410/blob/master/doc/eda_report.md) in the [`doc`](../doc/) directory*

### Assumptions

We decided to limit our analysis to the top five global soccer leagues:

* Premier League (England)
* LaLiga (Spain)
* Bundesliga (Germany)
* Serie A (Italy)
* Ligue 1 (France)
 
To measure how overrated a player is, we decided to create an `Overpaid_Index`.  This index was calculated as a player's total salary (in millions) divided by their overall FIFA rating (which is a measure of how 'good' a player is) and multiplied by 1000.
$$ Overpaid\ Index = \frac{salary (\$M)}{FIFA\ rating}1000 $$

### Wrangling and Cleaning

When we first went to join the dataframes, there were many mismatching `Club` names between the two datasets (for example, things like `Manchester United` versus `Manchester Utd`).  After joining the tables,we also made new columns for the following features:
 
- `Salary`(in millions) was calculated based on the weekly `Wage` data from the FIFA dataset
- `Domestic` was assigned a value of 1 when a player had the same `Nationality` as the league's `Country`
- `Overpaid_Index` was calculated as described above
 
The joining of the two dataframes, and this wrangling and cleaning step is performed by the [`cleaning_leagues_table.r`](../src/cleaning_leagues_table.ipynb) script in the [`src`](../src/) directory using the programming language R [@R] and the tidyverse [@tidyverse] package.

### Analysis and Results

To test our hypothesis, we used R's [@R] `lm()` function to build linear models and the `broom` [@broom] package to view and interpret results.  Our steps were as follows:

- First, we fit a simple linear model associating `Overpaid_Index` with the player type (either `Domestic` or `Foreign`) as a baseline.
- We then fit an additive linear model to see the effect of both `League` and the player type (either `Domestic` or `Foreign`) on the `Overpaid_Index`.
- We also fit a linear model with interaction to see whether the relation between the player type and `Overpaid_Index` changes for different leagues.

Once we had our three models, we used the `anova()` function to see if our additive and interaction models with the extra `League` term significantly improved our simple baseline model. Our findings were as follows:

- *Comparing additive model to baseline*: adding the extra `League` term in the additive model improved the baseline model at the 0.05 significance level (the p-value was `r scientific(anova_1[['Pr(>F)']][2], 3)`).
- *Comparing model with interaction to additive*: adding the interaction term significantly improved the additive model at the 0.05 significance level (the p-value was `r scientific(anova_2[['Pr(>F)']][2], 3)`).

Based on these results, we concluded that it was important to use our interaction model and look at the relationship for each league.  The overall results are summarized in Table 2 below.

```{r summary table}
df <- summary_df %>% 
  select(-X1) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ as.character(signif(., 3)))
kable(df, caption = "**Table 2. Results of Comparing the Relationship of Player Origin to Overpaid Index**")
```

From Table 2 we see that there is a difference in the mean overpaid index between domestic and foreign players, however it is not what we expected. Foreign players have a higher mean overpaid index than domestic players. Looking at the p-values, this relationship is significant for 4 out the 5 top leagues. The only exception is France's Ligue 1 where the p-value of 0.115 indicates that the difference in mean overpaid index between domestic and foreign players is not significant at the 0.05 level.

Figure 1 shows all the data graphically.

![](../results/img/overpaid_plot.png)

Looking at the figure, this pattern that foreign players are more overvalued than domestic players becomes more clear. The black diamonds on each plot represent the mean overpaid index and the jittered points in the background represent all players. Even though there is scatter, we see that upper end of the overpaid index distribution (the most overpaid players) is higher for foreign players in all cases.  It should also be noted that the data has been plotted on a log scale, so the magnitude of the differences are actually greater than they may first appear.  Finally we see the biggest difference in Spain's LaLiga and England's Premier League, showing that my original hypothesis may have been extremely misguided. 

*Note: The analysis described above is performed by the [`analysis_overpaid.r`](../src/analysis_overpaid.r) script in the [`src`](../src/) directory.*

## Conclusions

We set out to test the hypothesis that the mean overpaid index is greater for domestic players than foreign players in the top 5 soccer leagues.  This was based on the theory that league homegrown quota rules result in domestic players being overvalued. We built linear models to test whether there was a significant relationship between a player's origin and their overpaid index and found that the relationship depends on the league the player is in.  Our final results showed that there was a significant relationship between mean overpaid index and player origin for 4 out of the 5 leagues.  However, the finding was that it is in fact foreign players who are more overvalued. 

Not only was our original hypothesis disproven; but instead we found that the opposite was true!
